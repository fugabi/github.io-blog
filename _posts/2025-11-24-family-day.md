She is looking forward to the museum visit and keeps asking which one we are going to. _Is it this one?_, she asks, pointing to every official-looking building we pass. _Or this one?_

When we are just a few steps from the entrance an older lady approaches us and asks if we are going in. I nod, curiously.

_Can I come with you?_, she asks. _It’s Family Day today and I’m alone. They won't let me in without a group, but I really want to see the exhibition. If we could just be a family for a couple of minutes... would that be okay?_

I don't really have a problem with it, so I look down at little N. Bundled up in her winter jacket, she looks at the lady and takes a very strong stance.

_No_, she says.

_But why not?_, the lady pleads. _It will only be for a short while. We’ll split up as soon as we get in and you’ll never see me again. I came all this way... I would be so disappointed to go home without seeing it._

N seems to be thinking a little longer.

_Okay_, she finally relents. I ask her again just to be sure, and she nods.

So, we go in. I walk straight to the desk and ask for a family ticket.

_Sure? Let me see: two adults and a child, right?_ The clerk stretches her neck a bit to look at little N behind the counter. _Coming right up._

She prints the tickets. And, as she lifts her hand to give them to us and starts offering instructions for the visit, little N shouts:

_She is not with us!_

Tickets in hand, just one step away from being let in, everybody freezes. I can hear the older lady muttering, trying to save face in a funny way.

_Kids... You can count on them to tell the truth when you least expect it!_

The ticket clerk stares at us. She is hesitating for a couple of seconds and then she just smiles as if nothing happened and hands over the tickets.

_Have a nice visit!_
